# React TypeScript Fitness

## Description
This is a modern and fully responsive single page web application. 

I haven't worked on a React project in a while, so I saw this as an opportunity to both brush up on my React skills and dive into learning TypeScript.

In this project, I gained valuable experience in working with React Hooks, specifically implementing a hook to determine the user's screen size. Additionally, I explored the integration of TypeScript in React, deepening my understanding of types and interfaces. I also discovered the immediate advantages of using TypeScript, as it provides helpful debugging messages in the terminal, enhancing the development process.
